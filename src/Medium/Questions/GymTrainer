As the number of ways can be huge, return the answer modulo 109+7.

NOTE: If there is any person who walks with one person and talks with the another person, then you may return 0.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A, N, M <= 105

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1], C[i][0], C[i][1] <= A



Input Format

The first argument contains an integer A, representing the number of people.
The second argument contains a 2-D integer array B of size N x 2, where B[i][0] and B[i][1] are friends because they walk together.
The third argument contains a 2-D integer array C of size M x 2, where C[i][0] and C[i][1] are friends because they talk together.



Output Format

Return an integer representing the number of ways to suggest one of the two diets to the people.

 Diet-2 to (1, 2) and Diet-1 to (3, 4).
 Diet-2 to (1, 2) and Diet-2 to (3, 4).
