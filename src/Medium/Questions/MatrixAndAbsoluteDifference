Problem Description

Given a matrix C of integers, of dimension A x B.

For any given K, you are not allowed to travel between cells that have an absolute difference greater than K.

Return the minimum value of K such that it is possible to travel between any pair of cells in the grid through a path of adjacent cells.

NOTE:

Adjacent cells are those cells that share a side with the current cell.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A, B <= 102

1 <= C[i][j] <= 109



Input Format

The first argument given is A.

The second argument give is B.

The third argument given is the integer matrix C.



Output Format

Return a single integer, the minimum value of K.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 3
 B = 3
 C = [  [1, 5, 6]
        [10, 7, 2]
        [3, 6, 9]   ]


Example Output

Output 1:

 4


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:


 It is possible to travel between any pair of cells through a path of adjacent cells that do not have an absolute
 difference in value greater than 4. e.g. : A path from (0, 0) to (2, 2) may look like this:
 => (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)
