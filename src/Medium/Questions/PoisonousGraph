Problem Description
You are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of A vertices and M edges given in a form of 2D Matrix B of size M x 2 where (B[i][0], B][i][1]) denotes two nodes connected by an edge.

You have to write a number on each vertex of the graph. Each number should be 1, 2 or 3. The graph becomes Poisonous if for each edge the sum of numbers on vertices connected by this edge is odd.

Calculate the number of possible ways to write numbers 1, 2 or 3 on vertices so the graph becomes poisonous. Since this number may be large, return it modulo 998244353.

NOTE:

Note that you have to write exactly one number on each vertex.
The graph does not have any self-loops or multiple edges.
Nodes are labelled from 1 to A.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 3*105

0 <= M <= 3*105

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A

B[i][0] != B[i][1]



Input Format
First argument is an integer A denoting the number of nodes.

Second argument is an 2D Matrix B of size M x 2 denoting the M edges.



Output Format
Return one integer denoting the number of possible ways to write numbers 1, 2 or 3 on the vertices of given graph so it becomes Poisonous . Since answer may be large, print it modulo 998244353.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = [  [1, 2]
     ]
Input 2:

 A = 4
 B = [  [1, 2]
        [1, 3]
        [1, 4]
        [2, 3]
        [2, 4]
        [3, 4]
    ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 There are 4 ways to make the graph poisonous. i.e, writing number on node 1 and 2 as,
    [1, 2] , [3, 2], [2, 1] or [2, 3] repsectively.
Explanation 2:

 There is no way to make the graph poisonous.
