Problem Description

Given character matrix A of O's and X's, where O = white, X = black.

Return the number of black shapes. A black shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included)



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A|,|A[0]| <= 1000

A[i][j] = 'X' or 'O'



Input Format

The First and only argument is character matrix A.



Output Format

Return a single integer denoting number of black shapes.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [ [X, X, X], [X, X, X], [X, X, X] ]
Input 2:

 A = [ [X, O], [O, X] ]


Example Output

Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 All X's belong to single shapes
Explanation 2:

 Both X's belong to different shapes
